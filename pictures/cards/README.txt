This are the svg files of the pictures I use in my app.

I exported these files to png versions and put them in the drawables folder from the app. 

All files are created using Inkscape. If you want to use them, you should use Inkscape too, because Gimp or the default picture viewer from Linux Mint do not display everything like Inkscape does. (For exampe the backgrounds_stacks file)
