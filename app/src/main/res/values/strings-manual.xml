    <string name="manual_startpage_text">Welcome to the manual of this game collection! I hope it will explain everything.
        \n\nUse the menu on the left side to access the other manual pages.</string>
    <string name="manual_general_main_menu">The usage of the main menu is relatively simple. Just tap on a game to start it.
        \n\nThe app will automatically load the last played game on a restart, if the app was paused in it. This behavior can
        be disabled in the settings under \"General\".\n\nThere you can also find the section \"Main menu\", where it\'s possible to hide games
        from the menu and change the number of columns, so more games fit on the screen at once.</string>
    <string name="manual_ui_text">A game will always show a little menu on the bottom part of the screen (Portrait mode) or on the
        right side (Landscape mode). It will also show the current score and current played time of the game. If possible, these two values
        will be saved for the high-score list. The menu contains 5 items, which have the following effects (buttons
        from left to right):\n\nThe \"Scores\" button will show a new window with the high scores and the count of won games of
        the current game.\n\nThe \"Hint\" button will help you by showing up to 3 possible card movements at once. But this will decrease
        the current score by 25. Notice that trivial movements like moving every card to an empty field or pressing on the main
        stack aren\'t shown as a hint. If no hint was shown, the score won\'t decrease.\n\nThe \"Menu\" button shows three different
        actions: Start a new game by mixing the cards and drawing a new deal. Give cards again will do the same but without the
        mixing. So it\'s like a restart of the current game. The last option will end the current game and return the app to the
        main menu.\n\nThe \"Undo\" button will revert the last movement, but this will cost 25 points. This can be used for up to
        20 last movements.\n\nThe \"Settings\" button simply opens the settings menu.</string>
    <string name="manual_feedback_text">Found a bug or an error? Something I should improve? Should I add another game to the
        collection? Maybe you want to help with some translations? Or have another idea?\n\nI am happy to receive any kind of
        feedback. If you feel the need to contact me, you should consider the following two options:\n\nUse the Issue Tracker
        on GitHub: The project of this app on GitHub has a neat function to report issues. Just click on the button on the left
        side of the screen to open the Issue Tracker with the Internet browser.\n\nUse a rating in Google Play: Just leave a
        rating on the page from this app and write anything you want in it. Click on the button to the right side to open the
        Google Play Store (if installed).\n\nThank you in advance for your feedback :)</string>
